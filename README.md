## Introduction

**SafePulse** is the inaugural application of the Contract Foundry ecosystem, a sovereign onchain agreement acosystem.
      
This permissioned but non-custodial infrastructure converges decentralized identity, tamper-proof document verification, and non-custodial smart contracts to replace intermediary-dependent processes with immutable, executable logic.

Within this environment, financial obligations are bound directly to verifiable actions. Onchain digital signatures autonomously control the flow of capital through P2P escrow and payments, ensuring execution is contingent solely upon cryptographically proven performance.

The result is a closed-loop system that eliminates disputes by design, providing a court-admissible record of truth and establishing a new paradigm of operational integrity.

---

## Mission and Vision

Our mission is to build a world where individuals and organizations have **complete sovereignty** over their assets, data, and digital identity—empowering them to engage in **trustless, borderless agreements** without dependence on intermediaries.

We envision a future where **privacy, security, and autonomy** are built into every transaction, enabling **decentralized collaboration** at scale. By combining blockchain, verifiable credentials, and decentralized identity, SafePulse redefines how people transact, verify, and trust—onchain and on their own terms.

## SafePulse Wallet: The Secure Gateway to the ContractFoundry Ecosystem

SafePulse Wallet is the official, non-custodial interface for the Contract Foundry ecosystem, engineered to provide users with direct and sovereign control over their onchain agreements and assets. It functions as the primary command center for interacting with ecosystem smart contracts, enabling the management of digital identity, the execution of legally-binding document signatures, and the autonomous control of financial obligations and subscriptions.

Architected with security as its foundation, the wallet ensures all cryptographic operations from private key management to transaction and document signing are processed locally on the user's device. Private keys are secured within a multi-encryption-layered local database and never leave the client environment. Developed according to stringent secure coding principles, this design eliminates central points of failure, guaranteeing that users retain absolute, non-custodial control over their data and funds while engaging with the enterprise-grade capabilities of the Contract Foundry.
